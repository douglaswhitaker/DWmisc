Footnotes:
1,Figures may not add to totals due to rounding.
2,"Length of road network in terms of 2-lane equivalent kilometres, where one kilometre of a four-lane highway is counted as two kilometres."
3,"Very poor: The asset is unfit for sustained service. Near or beyond expected service life, widespread signs of advanced deterioration, some assets may be unusable."
4,Poor: Increasing potential of affecting service. The asset is approaching end of service life; condition below standard and a large portion of system exhibits significant deterioration.
5,Fair: The asset requires attention. The assets show signs of deterioration and some elements exhibit deficiencies.
6,"Good: The asset is adequate. Acceptable, generally within mid stage of expected service life."
7,"Very good: Asset is fit for the future. Well maintained, good condition, new or recently rehabilitated."
